# Initial setup
I used seven-of-eleven's very helpful guide for a Lenovo L13 Yoga, since specs are quite similar. You can check out his repo at https://github.com/seven-of-eleven/Lenovo-ThinkPad-L13-Yoga-Hackintosh

I encountered many problems that kept my device from working fine:
- System would reboot instantly (had to remove YogaSMC to get it to start properly)
- System would reboot before sleeping
- Touchpad gestures would work erratically (L14 uses SMBUS to interface with the touchpad, unlike L13's I2C)
- Battery wouldn't show up
- Power management broken
- Wi-Fi wouldn't work after sleep
