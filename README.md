Attempt at running macOS Big Sur (11.2.2) on a Thinkpad L14 Gen 1 (Intel). Specs are as follows:

<summary><strong>What's NOT working</strong></summary>

- Brightness and special keys
- Sidecar or Handoff
- HDMI (fix coming soon)
- Micro SD Card Reader

<summary><strong>Notes</strong></summary>

- Brightness and special keys are not functioning as of now. The SSDT patch related to the keyboard comes from an E14, so it needs to be replaced with a custom patch.
- Sleep and Wake needs extended testing. From closing the lid to actual sleeping it takes around 45 seconds.
- A Broadcom Wi-Fi card is recommended.
- Battery life isn't quite up to spec. I suspect it is because of the CFG Lock, which cannot be disabled without BIOS modding (requires hardware).
- I haven't tested USB-C adapters or displays yet.

# Initial setup
I used AniKulkarn's repo (https://github.com/AniKulkarn/Hackintosh-ThinkPad-E14) as its specs are quite similar.

I encountered many problems that kept my device from working fine:
- System would reboot instantly (had to remove YogaSMC to get it to start properly)
- System would reboot before sleeping
- Touchpad gestures would work erratically (E14 uses ELAN touchpad, while L14 uses Synaptics)
- Battery wouldn't show up
- Power management broken
- Wi-Fi wouldn't work after sleep
