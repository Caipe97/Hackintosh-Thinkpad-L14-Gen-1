<summary><strong>What's NOT working</strong></summary>

- Brightness keys and special keys (Brightness can be changed through settings)
- Sidecar or Handoff
- HDMI (fix coming soon)
- Micro SD Card Reader

<summary><strong>Notes</strong></summary>

- The SSDT patch related to the keyboard comes from an E14, so it needs to be replaced with a custom patch to make special keys work.
- Sleep and Wake needs extended testing. From closing the lid to actual sleeping it takes around 45 seconds. I had no problems with waking from sleep or hibernation for now
- A Broadcom Wi-Fi card is recommended.
- Battery life isn't quite up to spec. I suspect it is because of the CFG Lock, which cannot be disabled without BIOS modding (requires hardware). Also, the DSDT patch for the battery comes from a Lenovo L13.
- I haven't tested USB-C adapters or displays yet.
- DSDT Patches need cleanup.

# Initial setup
I used AniKulkarn's repo (https://github.com/AniKulkarn/Hackintosh-ThinkPad-E14) as its specs are quite similar, then appended my changes to kexts and DSDT Patches.
